# Voidtamer
A game about exploring the void and building a home therein.

This game is a crafting game utilizing procedural generation. Each map is unique, functionally infinite, and generated deterministically. The player can pick up resources from the map and bring them to crafting stations to build more advanced items, structures and crafting stations. As the player progressess, they will be able craft two very important types of items: pylons and minions. Pylons prevent sections of the map from falling into the void and protect the player's base. Minions can collect resources from the map and bring them to storage containers or automatically craft items for the player to use. As the game progressess, the player will control more territory but will have to travel further afield to find resources as nearby sources dry up.

Voidtamer was developed in Unity. The game can be played for free at kronuslost.itch.io/voidtamer.

This project and all its assets were made by Caleb Sullivan.
